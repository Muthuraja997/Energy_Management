# Energy Management RL Dashboard Implementation Notes

## Files Created

1. **app.py**: The main Streamlit dashboard application with interactive visualization
2. **run_dashboard.py**: A helper script to install dependencies and launch the dashboard
3. **requirements.txt**: List of dependencies needed for the dashboard
4. **README.md**: Documentation for the dashboard
5. **QUICK_START.md**: Quick start guide for using the dashboard
6. **test_streamlit.py**: A minimal test script to verify Streamlit installation

## Dashboard Features

The dashboard implements all the requested features:

- **Real-time Environment State Display**: Shows current demand, solar generation, battery SOC, electricity price, and time of day
- **Agent Action Visualization**: Displays the action chosen by the DQN agent with explanations
- **Interactive Charts**:
  - Demand vs Solar generation vs Price
  - Energy sources used (solar, battery, grid)
  - Battery State of Charge over time
  - Grid costs per step
  - Rewards (step and cumulative)
- **Simulation Controls**: Options to reset environment, step through simulation, or run a complete episode
- **Model Loading**: Ability to load pre-trained models or upload custom ones
- **Detailed Results Table**: Comprehensive view of all steps and metrics
- **Summary Statistics**: Total rewards, costs, energy usage

## How to Run

1. Install the required packages:
   ```
   pip install -r dashboard/requirements.txt
   ```

2. Launch the dashboard:
   ```
   streamlit run dashboard/app.py
   ```

3. Alternatively, use the helper script:
   ```
   python dashboard/run_dashboard.py
   ```

## Notes on Implementation

- The dashboard uses Streamlit's session state to maintain the environment and simulation state
- Plotly is used for interactive charts that update in real-time
- The dashboard integrates directly with the existing environment and DQN model
- The UI is designed to be intuitive and user-friendly with clear labels and explanations

## Customization Options

The dashboard can be extended in several ways:

1. Add more visualization types (e.g., heatmaps for hourly usage patterns)
2. Implement comparison views for different models
3. Add parameter tuning for the environment (e.g., adjust battery capacity)
4. Create scenario builders to test different demand/solar profiles
5. Add export functionality for simulation results
